============

Here's what I think it should include:

name of the projects and all sub-modules and libraries (sometimes they are named different and very confusing to new users)

File hierarchy is split up into 6 sections in an attempt to organize development according to MVC design principles:

1. bb.controller - contains all controller classes
2. bb.gui.view - contains all styling files for controllers (.fxml and .css)
3. bb.lib - foundation for musicality of program; defines what a note, scale, key etc is.
4. bb.producers - 
5. bb.strategies -
6. bb.util -







descriptions of all the project, and all sub-modules and libraries
5-line code snippet on how its used (if it's a library)
copyright and licensing information (or "Read LICENSE")
instruction to grab the documentation
instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs
instruction to grab the latest code and detailed instructions to build it (or quick overview and "Read INSTALL")
list of authors or "Read AUTHORS"
instructions to submit bugs, feature requests, submit patches, join mailing list, get announcements, or join the user or dev community in other forms
other contact info (email address, website, company name, address, etc)
a brief history if it's a replacement or a fork of something else
legal notices (crypto stuff)
MIDI files are stored in the install folder.
